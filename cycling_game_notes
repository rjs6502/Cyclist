Cycling Game:

- individual racer until you reach a certain overall rating then you can qualify to be picked up by a team
- you play the game as an individual rider
- races auto-gen "open-racers" but at the start of game, pro teams are made and generated with a team of riders
- come up with conversion function to take ratings and make them mph
- a rider only knows about their current speed --> an object knows how much to reduce speed by --> the Event handles all the checking
- speed * time = distance <-- use this for seeing how far the riders have gone and how far they have left
